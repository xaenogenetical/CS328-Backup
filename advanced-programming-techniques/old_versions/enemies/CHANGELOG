Realized i'm gonna have to convert my queue to generics because I made it only work with node_t before in order to make the program run better
Created enemies.h to start complying more with C standards instead of shoving everything in dungeonutil.h
Implemented the enemy move algo and allowed enemies to calc player loc when they move
Moved some stuff from dungeonutil.h to homemadeq.h
3/1/25
Converted homemadeq to void stuff so it supports any payload type
3/2/25
changed main.c to reflect the new objective of the program
added the logic which figures out how an enemy should move
3/4/25
Did a lot really late at night and dont exactly remember the order, edits include but are not limited to: store and retrieve enemy display char & speed, made enemies who can't tunnel not tunnel, logic to determine who's turn it is to move, and more.

Finishing touches, Implemented enemy speed properly
Made tunneling monsters act like theyre supposed to (subtract from hardness then turn it to corridor);
