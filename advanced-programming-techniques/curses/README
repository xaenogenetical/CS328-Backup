Hi. Call 'make' from within this directory to create "enemy" which can be run to create a simulation of enemy behavior
You can also use --save or --load on the command line to save/load a dungeon from a dedicated file(make sure to have an existing file before trying to --load or else)
You can also use --nummon <number> to set the amount of enemies to simulate. (The program will randomly pick the amount otherwise)

If the character 'G' appears on the map, please ignore it for now. That is a debug char I have implemented to handle error when killing an entity. It will be fixed soon but it only
started appearing just now during my last minute tweaks (3.5.2025 11:50pm) and I don't think I'm gonna be able to find the source of the error and fix it in the next 10 mins
