Hi. Call 'make' from within this directory to create heatmap then execute heatmap with no args to generate the enemy pathfinding maps
You can also use --save or --load on the command line to save/load a dungeon from a dedicated file(make sure to save or have an existing file before loading or else)
Note: the program will only draw the heatmap if no args are used. 

Files:
README- This
CHANGELOG - Series of updates on my struggles in creating this particular program
dungeonutil.h - Header file used by all of the C files in this directory
dungenerator.c, saveloader.c, heatmap.c - The three main files that make up the program
Makefile - Makefile for the program
main.c - Main file for the program which handles the command line arguments and calls the other files
homemadeq.c - My homemade priority queue that I used in the program, may or may not be revamped into a heap structure in the future
